  <h1> - Forever In Our Memory - </h1>
  <pr>
  In loving memory of a cherished soul,
  Whose presence made our lives whole.
  A mother, a grandmother, a great grandmother too,
  Her spirit lives on in all that we do.
  
  With gentle hands and a heart so kind,
  In her love and warmth, solace we'd find.
  Her laughter, her wisdom, forever will stay,
  Guiding us through each passing day.
  
  In the tapestry of our lives, she wove a thread,
  A legacy of love, never to be shed.
  Her smile illuminated our darkest night,
  Guiding us towards the path of light.
  
  Though she may be gone, her love remains,
  In the gentle breeze and soft summer rains.
  For in our hearts, she'll forever reside,
  A beacon of love, a constant guide.
  
  Rest now, dear mother, in eternal peace,
  Your memory in our hearts will never cease.
  As we bid farewell, with tearful eyes,
  We'll cherish the memories, till we reunite in the skies.
  
  In every bloom and every tree,
  Your spirit dances, wild and free.
  Though parted by the hands of fate,
  In our hearts, you'll forever await.
  
  So, let the angels sing their sweet refrain,
  For our beloved mother, grandmother, and great grandmother, once again.
  In the tapestry of eternity, her love will forever gleam,
  A timeless tribute to a life well esteemed.
